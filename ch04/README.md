### Technical requirements

You'll need Docker to run the examples from this chapter.

For the tracing and reverse proxy, and the canary releases example you'll
also need Docker Compose.

To run the examples, please go to the appropriate directory and run:

```
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

To stop the examples, execute:

```
./stop.sh
```
