### Technical requirements

You'll need Docker to run the examples from this chapter.

For the tracing and reverse proxy, and the canary releases example you'll
also need Docker Compose.

### Running the examples

To run the examples, please go to the appropriate directory and run:

```
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

To stop the examples, execute:

```
./stop.sh
```
